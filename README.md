The web store project "Saška S. - The Studio" should offer search and purchase of modern fashionable products for its users. With a wide selection of clothing and accessories, users can browse styles that suit their taste and needs. The appearance and assumed functionality of the application are in accordance with [the web page design project in the Figma web page prototype development environment](https://www.figma.com/design/a1a1F9hDzFrbcFIZcKoBRc/Prodavnica-modnih-proizvoda-domaci1) as part of Homework no. 1.

As part of the React-router-based application skeleton with fixed **Header** and **Footer** components, the following pages are fully implemented as part of Homework no. 2 requirements:

1. **Home page**, with a link to the products page, highlighted collection of fashionable products for beach and recommended products, filtered on client (browser) side from loaded products (mocked server response from .json file via fetch request)

2. **Login page**, according to design, with input fields for submiting user email and password to the server (with help of **useFormInput** custom React hook) and to obtain verified user data (mocked server response from .json file via fetch request)

3. **Products page**, showing fashionable products in cards (**ProductItem** component) within a 2D grid from a page of product data, selected within **Pagination** component (to list other product pages as well), that users can filter on client (browser) side on max price and a category selected out of automatically (reactively) generated list of all unique categories from loaded products (mocked server response from .json file via fetch request) within **FilterByCategory** component; each product card is a link to its details page and consists of product image and a row with price information, **Add to cart** and Favourites (‪‪❤︎‬ icon) buttons at bottom of the product image to push the selected product into cart (and redirecting to the *Cart* page); page number and products per page are obtained from URL search params via **loader** function as attribute of the corresponding **Route** component with path name **/products** and used with built-in hook **useLoaderData** in **ProductsPage** component; according to products per page and total number of records (products) obtained from server (in .json file, along with products page data), max number of pages is calculated within **Paginator** component, as well as what links to page numbers should be shown, also in terms of number of links to be shown around the current page (as **Paginator** component attribute)

4. **Cart page** (with cart items being independent from products on page in the last version, so cart can collect product items from all pages) firstly accepts a selected product from **Products page** within a cart item (**CartItem** component) for user to select the size and the number of fashion product items (amount) and (by clicking on a corresponding **Save** button) save the item in the cart with those complete information; the same **CartItem** component is used to show purchased items of all sizes of a product; within the **Cart summary** block, the number and price of items to be purchased are reactively calculated, along with total price and savings obtained by application of a promo code (approval of which being mocked by corresponding .json files consisting information about discount and type of calculation - *percentage* or *difference* - in the suitable schema)

5. **No Page template**, set in the router to be applied correctly, for any page not listed in the Route components

All project files are structured according to their role in the project (namely components, models, hooks and pages) within corresponding subfolders of **/src** project folder (with their corresponding .css style files along in the same folder). Public data used in the site are structured within **/img** and **/data** subfolders of **/public** folder. Basic logic and structure for products are implemented in the **productModel** model class. User data structure is implemented in the **User** interface. Strongly-typed features are achieved by means of **Size** and **FilterOperation** enums of defined possible product sizes and filter operations respectively, **EnumKeys< T >** and **ObjectKeysFromEnum<T, P>** types, also exported from **productModel.ts** file (product sizes implemented as possible keys in *amounts* object property of **Product** class for storing numbers of purchased product items of corresponding sizes, or **FilterData** type expecting **Product** object properties as keys - also the fields filter operations should be applied to)
